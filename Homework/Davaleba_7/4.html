            <p>
                Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
                 production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web 
                 design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including 
                 standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and 
                 search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering
                  different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover 
                  them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design proces
                  s relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing
                   markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web 
                   development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their 
                   role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web 
                   accessibility guidelines.

                In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext
                 project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 
                 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a s
                 imple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the 
                 Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of 
                 them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach 
                 to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.
            </p> <br>

                Although web design has a fairly recent history. It can be linked to other areas such as graphic design,
                 user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has become 
                 a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, 
                 different styles of typography, background, and music. 
            </p> <br>

                In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and
                 HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an 
                 obscure authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design.
